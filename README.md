# OAuth in Golang
Welcome! This is my fun little project to explore authentication in Golang. Golang is a pretty useful language for web development and I wanted to develop my skills in Golang further with this project.
Currently, the workflow is very simple, you will see a login page first, then be redirected to some authenticator, then I will respond with a page where you can chat with others that are able to access the page.
The page is currently not hosted on a real web server so it is limited. But you can talk with yourself :)

## How to start
Pretty straightforward, enter the command `go main.go` in the terminal and you're good to go!
